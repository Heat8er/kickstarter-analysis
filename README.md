### Challenge
Analysis performed on Kick-starter data to identify trend and determine if the length of a campaign contributes to its ultimate success or failure and also the number of campaigns similar to Fever were able to reach their fundraising goal in a short amount of time. ---
The data analysis shows the campaign outcomes based on the goal amount and the outcomes based on the launch date.  What the data fails to demonstrate is the outcome based on the length of the campaign.  The trend for outcomes based on the camapign goal shows as the goal amount goes up the percentage of failure is greater with a few spikes in the data at the $35,000 to $44,999 goal range.  The outcome based on the launch date demonstrates theaters were more successful launching campaigns in the month of May with a downward trend month over month leading to the least successful month of December.  To better demonstrate and draw a comparison of the play Fever and other campaigns, we could present the data based on a similar time frame of approximately 1 month and their outcomes based on goals as well as data with similar launch months of mid year.  I would also recommend limiting our data set to more similar goal amounts to directly associate the data to the play Fever.
